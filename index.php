			<p>I'm a web developer based south of the great city of Boston.</p>

			<p>I work with my clients to create not only what they want but what they need.</p>

			<p>I am still new to the game but I am developing new skills and tricks every day.</p>

			<p>Check out what I have been up to at <a href="http://blog.evanamccullough.com" target="_blank">my blog</a>.</p>

				<h2>Who Am I?</h2>
				<p>I am currently enrolled at Suffolk University pursuing my BS/BA in Information Systems and Operations Management (ISOM). When I initially enrolled in school my plan was to be a Psychology major, but I quickly learned that it was not my passion. I had wanted to take a web development course, but was never selected. In my second semester of college I saw an opening for an intro class to HTML and PHP, I took advantage of this opportunity and was captivated by it. I explained to my advisor my interest in the class and he told me about ISOM, which is a mix of technical work and business fundamentals. I was so unsure of what I wanted to do after graduation, I decided that this could be a good fit because of the business aspect. I am now halfway through my senior year and am eager to build my education and work experiences as I begin my professional career. When not in class, I like spending time with my friends, playing video games, catching up on my favorite shows, crossfitting, and learning more about web and application development.</p>

				<h2>What Am I Doing?</h2>

				<p>I aspire to be a web developer, both freelance and professionally. Working with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the Federal Reserve has taught me what end users prefer to see in regards to layout and content. Most of my personal projects have been created using a text editor such as Notepad++ and Text Wrangler, while the rest have been made in Dreamweaver. Being able to write and understand code used in building a site is something every web developer should know.</p>

				<h2>Why Do I Do The Things I Do?</h2>
				<p>Everyone wants to leave something behind, whether it is a hit song, a painting, or simply a carving on a tree. I want people to remember me because of my contributions to the web. People can view anything on the Internet anywhere and at any time. In 20 years I would like to be able to point out a site or a program and say, "I was a part of that" or "I created that." This may come across as clich&eacute;, but I believe that my calling is working to develop sites or programs that will make the user's experience more enjoyable.</p>
